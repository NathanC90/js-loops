# js-loops

This is a 3-task exercise to test my Javascript skills regarding Loops.

## Loop 1

In the first task, it is required to start by creating a simple loop that goes through all the items in the provided myArray
and prints them out on the screen inside list items (i.e., li elements), which are appended to the provided list.

Since we only need to print out all the items and don't need access to the index position of each item, I use `for...of` for the best practice according to [this article from MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code#which_loop_type_should_you_use).

To ensure the items are shown as list items, I use innerHTML instead of textContent and add li tags around the texts.


## Loop 2

## Loop 3
